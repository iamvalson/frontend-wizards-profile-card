## Notes

This project fully complies with the Frontend Wizards Stage 0 Test Requirements:

✅ All required `data-testid` attributes exist and are discoverable.  
✅ HTML uses semantic tags: `article`, `figure`, `header`, `section`, `ul`, and `h1–h2`.  
✅ The time in milliseconds accurately reflects `Date.now()` at render/update.  
✅ Avatar renders with an `alt` attribute and `data-testid="test-user-avatar"`.  
✅ Social links open in a new tab and are individually testable.  
✅ Hobbies and Dislikes are distinct lists with unique `data-testids`.  
✅ Keyboard navigation works; focus styles are visible.  
✅ Layout is responsive at typical breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop).
