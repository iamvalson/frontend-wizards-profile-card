        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>
            I've always been fascinated by the intersection of design and technology. My journey into frontend development began three years ago when I built my first website which was a simple portfolio page that sparked a passion for creating beautiful, functional user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, I've immersed myself in learning modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I believe that great frontend development isn't just about writing code, it's about understanding user needs, creating accessible interfaces, and continuously improving the craft.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I'm an advocate for open-source software and love contributing to projects that make the web a better place for everyone.

        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>
            My primary goal is to deepen my understanding of advanced React patterns and state management solutions. I want to build more complex, scalable applications that can handle real-world use cases.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Master TypeScript and advanced type systems</li>
            <li>Learn performance optimization techniques</li>
            <li>Build accessible, inclusive web applications</li>
            <li>Understand modern testing strategies and tools</li>
            <li>Contribute to meaningful open-source projects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I also want to improve my collaboration skills and learn best practices for working in distributed teams, as I believe great software is built by great teams.

        <h3>Areas of Growth</h3>
        <p>
            I believe in being honest about areas where I need to grow. Here are some challenges I'm actively working to overcome:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Backend integration:</b> While I'm comfortable with frontend code, I sometimes struggle with understanding complex API architectures and backend concepts.</li>
            <li><b>System design:</b> I'm still building confidence in architecting large-scale applications from scratch without a clear blueprint.</li>
            <li><b>CSS animations:</b> While I can implement basic animations, creating smooth, performant custom animations is still a learning curve</li>
            <li><b>Browser compatibility:</b> Debugging cross-browser issues can be frustrating, and I'm working on building a better mental model for how different browsers handle CSS and JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I view these areas not as weaknesses, but as opportunities for growth. Each challenge is a stepping stone toward becoming a more well-rounded developer.

        <h3>Note to Future Self</h3>
        <p>
            <i>"Dear future me,</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember this moment: the excitement, the uncertainty, the eagerness to learn. You're embarking on a journey that will challenge you, but also transform you into the developer you've always wanted to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be discouraged by bugs or errors, they're not failures, they're lessons. Celebrate small wins: every component you build, every concept you grasp, every line of clean code you write.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stay curious. Stay humble. And most importantly, remember why you started: to create things that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
            You've got this. <i>Keep coding, keep learning, keep growing."</i>

        <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            The tech industry moves fast, and it can feel overwhelming at times. I've learned that it's okay not to know everything. What matters is having a strong foundation and the ability to learn and adapt quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm particularly excited about the future of web developmentâ€”technologies like Web Assembly, server components, and AI-assisted development are opening up new possibilities. But I also believe in focusing on fundamentals: semantic HTML, accessible design, and writing maintainable code will always be relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hope is that through this program, I'll not only become a better developer but also a better collaborator, communicator, and problem-solver. The goal isn't just to write code, it's to build solutions that matter.
